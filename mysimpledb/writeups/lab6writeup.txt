Report for Lab 6
----------------

Exercise 1.

1. Briefly explain how logging is done in SimpleDB by describing when log records are written to the log.  Use Eclipse search tools to find all uses of the LogFile methods in the SimpleDB source code.

    Log records are written to the log 
    1) When a transaction is started, in Transaction.start()
    2) Before a page is flushed to disk, in BufferPool.flushPage()
    3) When a transaction is aborted, in Transaction.transactionComplete()  
    4) When a transaction is committed, in Transaction.transactionComplete() 

2. Where is LogFile.force called?  You should include usages inside other LogFile methods.  For each usage, why is it important that force is called?

    LogFile.force is called in BufferPool.flushPage, so that the log has records of everything that is flushed to disk.
    This ensures that the write-ahead logging principle is followed. LogFile.force is also called in logAbort, logCommit,
    and logCheckpoint in the LogFile class, to ensure that these records are present in the log on disk whenever one 
    of these methods are called. 


3. Where is setBeforeImage image called?  

    setBeforeImage is called in BufferPool.transactionComplete() if a transaction is committing.


Exercise 4.

In answering the next few questions, oncy include method calls in the source code; method calls in the test code can be ignored.
