Report for Lab 6
----------------

Exercise 1.

1. Briefly explain how logging is done in SimpleDB by describing when log records are written to the log.  Use Eclipse search tools to find all uses of the LogFile methods in the SimpleDB source code.

    Log records are written to the log 
    1) When a transaction is started, in Transaction.start()
    2) Before a page is flushed to disk, in BufferPool.flushPage()
    3) When a transaction is aborted, in Transaction.transactionComplete()  
    4) When a transaction is committed, in Transaction.transactionComplete() 

2. Where is LogFile.force called?  You should include usages inside other LogFile methods.  For each usage, why is it important that force is called?

    LogFile.force is called in BufferPool.flushPage, so that the log has records of everything that is flushed to disk.
    This ensures that the write-ahead logging principle is followed. LogFile.force is also called in logAbort, logCommit,
    and logCheckpoint in the LogFile class, to ensure that these records are present in the log on disk whenever one 
    of these methods are called. 

3. Where is setBeforeImage image called?  

    setBeforeImage is called in BufferPool.transactionComplete() if a transaction is committing.


Exercise 4.

In answering the next few questions, only include method calls in the source code; method calls in the test code can be ignored.

4. Where is BufferPool.flushPage called?  
    
    It is called in BufferPool.flushPages(), BufferPool.flushAllPages(), BufferPool.evictPage(). 
    

5. Where is BufferPool.flushPages(tid) called?

    In my code, it is not called anywhere (I commented it out from Transaction.transactionComplete() to support no-force.)
 
6. Where is BufferPool.flushAllPages called?

    It is called in LogFile.logCheckpoint()

7. To support a NO FORCE, STEAL policy, describe exactly when/where pages should be flushed to disk.

    Pages should be flushed to disk when we do a checkpoint for the log and when we evict a dirty page. Other than that 
    we don't need to flush anywhere else. We do need to flush entries to the log, however.

After you complete the lab, please answer the following questions.  

8. What is your name?  If you work with a partner, be sure to write both of your names.

    Anindya Guha

9. What did you think of this assignment?

    Easier than Lab 5

10. What was the hardest part of this assignment?

    Getting the no-force policy to work

11. Describe any missing or incomplete elements of your code.

    Everything should be complete, including the bonus.

12. Roughly how long did you spend working on this lab?

    At least 20 hours, possibly more
