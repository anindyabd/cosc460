Report for Lab 3
----------------

Answer the questions from the lab description here.  Questions 8 and 9 do not require answers.

1. The classes that implement the DbIterator interface are:

Aggregate, Delete, Filter, HashEquiJoin, Insert, Join, Operator, OrderBy, Project, SeqScan, TupleIterator

2. The subclasses of Operator are: 

Aggregate, Delete, Filter, HashEquiJoin, Insert, Join, OrderBy, Project

3. Select, Project, and Join are implemented as subclasses of Operator.

4. The Filter operator implements DbIterator by extending the abstract class Operator, 
in which next() and hasNext() are implemented. (Operator directly implements DbIterator). Thus, Filter uses the next() and hasNext() operations in its super class, Operator. 

5.  private Tuple currTuple;
    if currTuple == null:
        if iterR.hasNext():
            currTuple = iterR.next()
    while (iterR.hasNext()) :
        if currTuple matches predicate: 
            return currTuple
        currTuple = currTuple.next;
   return null;

6.  list = [] 
    if t1 == null:
        t1 = iterR.next();
    if t2 == null:
        t2 = iterR.next();
    while iterR.hasNext():
        while iterS.hasNext():
            if t1 and t2 match join predicate:
                tNew = merge(t1, t2) 
                list.append(tNew)
            t2 = iterS.next();
        iterS.rewind()
        t1 = iterR.next();
    return list

7.  while (t1 != null):
        if t1 == null:
            return null
        if t1 and t2 match join predicate:
            tNew = merge(t1, t2)
            if iterS.hasNext():
                t2 = iterS.next();
            else: 
                t2.rewind()
                t2 = iterS.next();
                
                if iterR.hasNext():
                    t1 = iterR.next();
                else:
                    t1 = null;
            
            return tNew;   
        
        else:
            if iterS.hasNext():
                t2 = iterS.next();
            else: 
                t2.rewind()
                t2 = iterS.next();
                
                if iterR.hasNext():
                    t1 = iterR.next();
                else:
                    t1 = null;
            if (t1 != null) and t1 and t2 match join predicate:
                tNew = merge(t1, t2)
                return tNew; 

            return null;
